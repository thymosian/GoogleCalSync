### 3. **AI-Assisted Scheduling**

- Users chat with the AI to schedule events.

- The AI suggests the **best time and date** based on the user’s availability in Google Calendar.
    
- Users provide or confirm:
    
    - Meeting link (if online).
        
    - Attendees.

### 4. **Agenda Generation & Distribution**

- When a meeting link and attendees are provided, the system:
    
    - Automatically generates a professional agenda for the meeting.
        
    - Sends the agenda to attendees via email.

### 5. **Simulated Meeting Recording & Transcript**

- To simulate the system “joining” a meeting:
    
    - The AI generates a **75–100-message transcript** using the agenda as context.
        
    - The transcript is saved in a local `/transcripts` directory to simulate Google Drive integration.
        
    - After analysis, the transcript is automatically deleted.

### 6. **AI-Powered Analysis & Summary**

- The stored transcript is analyzed by the AI.
    
- A concise **summary** of the meeting is emailed to attendees.
    
- From the summary, the system generates **action plans**:
    
    - Tasks.
        
    - Assignees.
        
    - Deadlines.

### 7. **Task Boards & Action Plan Management**

- A dedicated UI section allows users to view and manage action plans.
    
- For each meeting:
    
    - A board is automatically created.
        
    - Tasks from the action plan are assigned to appropriate attendees.
        
- Clicking a meeting shows all related tasks, assignees, and progress.
