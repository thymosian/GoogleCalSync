## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Test Auto-transition:**
   ```
   1. Create a new meeting
   2. Fill in title and enhanced purpose
   3. Navigate to agenda editor
   4. Verify it automatically shows preview (not edit)
   5. Click "Back to Editor" and verify you can edit
   ```

2. **Test Styling:**
   ```
   1. Check header appears with meeting title
   2. Verify meeting details display correctly
   3. Check that agenda content renders with proper formatting
   4. Test meeting link button on online meetings
   5. Verify on mobile/small screens (responsive)
   ```

3. **Test AI Improvements:**
   ```
   1. Create meeting with specific enhanced purpose
   2. Generate agenda and check if topics align with purpose
   3. Create another meeting with different purpose
   4. Verify agendas are different and purpose-specific
   5. Check that action items match meeting goals
   ```
