## üîÑ Workflow Verification

### Happy Path Flow
1. [x] User initiates meeting creation
2. [x] Meeting type selected (fades)
3. [x] Attendees added (fades)
4. [x] Title selected (fades)
5. [x] Event reviewed (fades)
6. [x] Meeting created
7. [x] Agenda generated
8. [x] Agenda edited/approved
9. [x] Email sent to attendees
10. [x] Completion

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] No attendees provided
- [ ] Invalid email addresses
- [ ] Email sending timeout
- [ ] Agenda validation failures
- [ ] Time extraction ambiguity
- [ ] Calendar API failures
- [ ] Multiple rapid clicks

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
1. **Email Template Service**
   - No SendGrid integration yet (Gmail API only)
   - No email scheduling
   - No attachment support
   - No HTML email preview in UI

2. **Time Extraction**
   - Some ambiguous cases may need clarification
   - No timezone handling beyond input
   - No holiday awareness
   - No business hours consideration

3. **Workflow Steps**
   - 'agenda_sending' and 'email_notification' steps added but transition logic not yet implemented
   - No automatic retry logic in orchestrator yet
   - No batch email optimization

4. **UI Components**
   - EmailSendingStatus is display-only (parent handles logic)
   - No email template preview in AgendaEditor
   - No individual email tracking UI

## üì¶ Dependencies

### No New External Dependencies Added
- All components use existing UI library (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS)
- All services use existing APIs (Gmail, Google Calendar)
- All time extraction uses existing patterns/regex

### Existing Dependencies Used
- React 18 (state management, hooks)
- Radix UI (components)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Lucide React (icons)
- Zod (validation)
- Drizzle ORM (database)

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
1. **Block Fade Effects**
   - CSS transitions (not re-renders)
   - Efficient opacity changes
   - No layout thrashing

2. **Email Templates**
   - Server-side rendering
   - Cached template functions
   - No DOM manipulation

3. **Time Extraction**
   - Regex-based (fast)
   - Early exit on match
   - No network calls

4. **Scrollable Events**
   - Native browser scrolling
   - No virtual scrolling needed for typical use
   - Fixed header reduces layout shift

### Future Performance Improvements
- [ ] Virtualize event list for 1000+ items
- [ ] Memoize email template generation
- [ ] Batch send emails asynchronously
- [ ] Cache time extraction results
