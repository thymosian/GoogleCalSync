# Enhanced Meeting Creation Workflow

This document describes the enhanced AI-powered meeting creation workflow implemented in the Google Calendar Sync application.

## Overview

The enhanced meeting creation workflow provides an intelligent, guided process for creating meetings through natural conversation with the AI assistant. The workflow includes:

1. Natural language meeting intent detection
2. Interactive Google Meet link inclusion choice
3. Smart attendee email verification
4. AI-generated meeting title suggestions
5. Final meeting review and creation

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Meeting Intent Detection

The AI assistant analyzes user messages to detect meeting creation intent using natural language processing.

**Detection Triggers:**
- "Let's schedule a meeting"
- "Can we meet tomorrow at 2pm?"
- "Set up a call with John about the project"
- "I want to organize a team discussion"

**Extracted Information:**
- Meeting purpose/topic
- Suggested participants
- Time constraints
- Duration preferences

### 2. Google Meet Link Choice

Users are presented with an interactive choice to include a Google Meet link:

```
[Yes, add link] [Skip]
```

This allows users to easily add video conferencing to their meetings.

### 3. Attendee Management

The attendee editor provides:
- Email validation
- Domain verification for trusted providers (Gmail, Google, Outlook, etc.)
- Visual verification indicators (green checkmarks)
- Real-time email verification through AI

**Verification Process:**
1. User enters email address
2. System validates email format
3. AI verifies email domain trustworthiness
4. Verified emails show a green checkmark
5. Unverified emails show "Unverified" status

### 4. AI-Generated Title Suggestions

The AI generates 3 professional meeting title suggestions based on:
- Meeting purpose
- Attendees
- Conversation context

Users can:
- Select one of the AI suggestions
- Enter a custom title

### 5. Final Review and Creation

Before creation, users review all meeting details:
- Meeting title
- Date and time
- Attendees with verification status
- Google Meet link status

A final "Create Meeting" button confirms the creation.
