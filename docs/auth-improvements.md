# Auth Page Improvements

## Overview
Simplified the authentication page and enhanced credential storage for persistent login experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Auth Page
- **Before**: Complex feature showcase with multiple cards and detailed explanations
- **After**: Clean, minimal design with just the essential sign-in functionality
- Shows last user info if available for better UX
- Simple checkbox for "Keep me signed in for 30 days"

### 2. Enhanced Session Management
- **Extended session duration**: 30 days for "remember me", 24 hours for regular login
- **Dynamic session extension**: Sessions automatically extend based on user activity
- **Server-side session handling**: Proper session cookie management with secure settings

### 3. Local Storage Integration
- **User preferences**: Remember me preference stored locally
- **Last user info**: Stores last authenticated user for better UX
- **Robust error handling**: Safe localStorage operations with fallbacks
- **Auto-cleanup**: Clears stored data on logout

### 4. Session Extension System
- **Automatic extension**: Sessions extend every 30 minutes for active users
- **Activity-based**: Extends on user interaction (mouse, keyboard, scroll, touch)
- **Throttled**: Prevents excessive API calls (max once per 5 minutes)
- **Background operation**: Works silently without user intervention

### 5. Improved Loading States
- **Smart loading**: Shows last user info while checking authentication
- **Visual feedback**: Better loading indicators with user context
- **Seamless experience**: Reduces perceived loading time
